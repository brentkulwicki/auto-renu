        <h2>AutoRenu</h2>
        <p>The Automotive Industry has changed, so has the ways car dealers make 
            money, retain employees, and take care of their customers. With cars 
            being built better than ever, and used-car sales making up the bulk of 
            dealership business, dealers and customers alike have a new need...the 
            cosmetic maintenance of their vehicles. AutoRenu serves both dealerships 
            and customers by providing new streams of revenue to the dealer, and 
            meeting the real need of cosmetic services to customers by keeping their 
            car looking as good as new for as long as they own it.
